# Weather Dashboard

This application is a live weather forecast for any destination you search.  This will display the current weather and the weather for the next 5 days.  I used [momentjs.com](https://momentjs.com/) and [openweathermap.org/api](https://openweathermap.org/api) to display the dates and weather conditions.  Here is a link to the deployed [application](https://isaias2020.github.io/Weather-Dashboard/).
